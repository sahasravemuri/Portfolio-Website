        <p>This innovative research project explores the intersection of technology and healthcare, combining my interests in medicine and computer science.</p>

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>For my science fair project, I investigated the impact of environmental triggers on asthma, focusing on how air quality affects respiratory health. I collected and analyzed data from different neighborhoods, comparing asthma prevalence with pollution levels, pollen counts, and humidity. Using this data, I identified patterns and potential correlations between environmental factors and asthma flare-ups. My findings highlighted the importance of clean air in preventing respiratory issues, especially for vulnerable populations.</p>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>I built a website that pulls real-time environmental data and alerts users, especially those with asthma, about days with potentially harmful conditions. My goal was to create a practical tool that helps people manage their health by staying informed. This project emphasized the link between public health and environmental justice, especially in underserved communities with poor air quality. I was honored to receive the DiIorio Foundation Award at the Science and Engineering Fair of Houston (SEFH) for this work in the health and medicine category.</p>
